    <h1>Project Sustainable Business Network 7: Mapping Trade Show Vendors, DS 4200 S20</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Samantha Hoch</strong>, <strong>Ankita Uppugunduri</strong>, <strong>Kees van Hemmen</strong></p>
    
    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>The Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts hosts an annual trade show to help connect local vendors with restaurants and markets.
      This visualization will help buyers better understand the types of vendors that typically attend the show and where the vendors come from.
      By making this data more accessible, buyers will be more inclined to attend the show.</em></p>
    
    <p><em>Expectation: There is a clear focus, and a developed explanation of the problem, and a reasonable response is proposed.</em></p>

    
    <h1>Visualization</h1>
    
    <p><em>Include the interactive visualization as part of this page. Static example follows.</em></p>
    
  </div>

  <!-- Your visualization here -->
  <div class="vis-holder">
    <!-- Change viewbox to whatever you want, e.g. "0 0 1000 6000" This determines your aspect ratio and coordinate system -->    
    <!-- Delete all the sample SVG code below after the viewbox to before the closing tag. Populate this part of the SVG with D3. -->

    <h1>Demo Video</h1>
    
    <p><em>Embedded MP4 demo video using the HTML5 &lt;video&gt; tag. For example, this screen recording Prof. Cody Dunne made of Mike Bostock's flexible transitions in D3 slide:</em></p>
    
    <video controls width="100%">
      <source src="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4" type="video/mp4">
      <p>Your browser doesn't support HTML5 video. Here is
       a <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/cody/courses/shared/d3-flexible-transitions.mp4">link to the video</a> instead.</p>
    </video>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Final visualization screenshots (PNG images), design justifications, UI walk-through, and linked presentation slides.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>
    <p><em>Summary of data, data types, and data preprocessing.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Data sources match the problem statement and are appropriate. These descriptions should be very explicit so someone could read your page and properly reproduce your results.</em></p>

    <p><em>		The data we are using for our interactive visualization is the Local Food Trade Show Vendor Application Specialty Crops dataset. The dataset has 20 columns, each of which is either a numerical value (ex.: zip code), text (ex.: products sold), or some combination of both (columns wherein a numerical value is specified, no is specified, or n/a). In order to make this data more usable we first indexed the data points (there was no primary key with which we could individually refer to rows by). We also standardized inputs in every column for effective grouping. This meant standardizing the N/A value (it was stored as na, N/A, and n/a in various places) and making any percentage value appear as a whole value, as opposed to a decimal, in the columns needed for our visualization. These columns were as follows: “Approximately what percentage of your products do you currently sell wholesale?”, “Do you have a goal for what percentage of your products you would like to sell wholesale?”, and “How long has your company been in business?”. Editing the zipcode columns was ultimately not necessary as the data was properly standardized. After the data cleaning was complete we converted the excel files into JSONs in the event that we would need them in that format. 
    </em></p>
    
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>Summary of task table.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Clearly describes domain tasks, processes, goals and abstract tasks for domain problems.</em></p>

    <h1>Design Process</h1>
    
    <p><em>Sketches and design choices to justify final visualization.</em></p>

    <p><em>Expectation: Evidence of iterative improvement.
    Logical discussion of design choices grounded in theory from course.
    Discusses feedback from usability testing.</em></p>
