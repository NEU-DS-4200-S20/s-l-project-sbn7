    <h1>Project Sustainable Business Network 7: Mapping Trade Show Vendors, DS 4200 S20</h1>
    
    <p><strong>Samantha Hoch</strong>, <strong>Ankita Uppugunduri</strong>, <strong>Kees van Hemmen</strong></p>
    
    <p>Service-Learning Course Project as part of <a href="https://canvas.instructure.com/courses/1781714">DS 4200: Information Presentation and Visualization</a>, taught by <a href="https://www.eecs.tufts.edu/~dcashm01/">Prof. Dylan Cashman</a>, <a href="https://visualization.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Data Visualization @ Khoury</a>, <a href="https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/">Northeastern University</a>.</p>
    
    
    <h1>Motivation</h1>
    
    <p><em>The Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts hosts an annual trade show to help connect local vendors with restaurants and markets.
      This visualization will help buyers better understand the types of vendors that typically attend the show and where the vendors come from.
      By making this data more accessible, buyers will be more inclined to attend the show.</em></p>

    <h1>Visualization explanation</h1>
    
    <p><em>Our final visualization has three elements: a map of the trade show vendors, a treemap of vendors by category, and a table containing more details.</em></p>

    <figure>
      <img src="images/map_screenshot.png" alt = "map" class = "centerimg">
    
      <figcaption>Screenshot of map with brushing.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p><em>The map shows the vendors’ locations by zip code. This is helpful for understanding general trends about where the vendors attending the trade show are from. If businesses are interested in working with vendors from a certain region, this map would be a good way to identify them. The user can brush over the map in order to select vendor zips codes to see more information about the vendors in the table. The map was designed to be very simple in order to highlight the zip code information. The colors chosen contrast each other so that the selection can be easily seen.</em></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/treemap_screenshot.png" alt = "treemap" class = "centerimg">
    
      <figcaption>Screenshot of treemap with brushing.</figcaption>
    </figure>

    <p><em>The treemap shows the vendors by category, with the size of the square referencing percentage of their products that they sell wholesale. Like the map, the treemap can be brushed over so that more information about certain vendors can be seen in the table. Any brushing on the treemap or map is reflected by the other one also being highlighted accordingly. The treemap colors reflect the category of the goods they represent.</em></p>
    
    <figure>
      <img src="images/table_screenshot.png" alt = "table" class = "center">
    
      <figcaption>Screenshot of sample table.</figcaption>
    </figure>


    <p><em>The table shows a large variety of information about the vendors that potential buyers might find interesting. This is intended to provide a deeper understanding of what types of products will be offered and what the vendors goals are for selling their goods.</em></p>

    <h1>Data Analysis</h1>

    <p><em>		The data we are using for our interactive visualization is the Local Food Trade Show Vendor Application Specialty Crops dataset. The dataset has 20 columns, each of which is either a numerical value (ex.: zip code), text (ex.: products sold), or some combination of both (columns wherein a numerical value is specified, no is specified, or n/a). In order to make this data more usable we first indexed the data points (there was no primary key with which we could individually refer to rows by). We also standardized inputs in every column for effective grouping. This meant standardizing the N/A value (it was stored as na, N/A, and n/a in various places) and making any percentage value appear as a whole value, as opposed to a decimal, in the columns needed for our visualization. These columns were as follows: “Approximately what percentage of your products do you currently sell wholesale?”, “Do you have a goal for what percentage of your products you would like to sell wholesale?”, and “How long has your company been in business?”. Editing the zipcode columns was ultimately not necessary as the data was properly standardized. After the data cleaning was complete we converted the excel files into JSONs in the event that we would need them in that format. 
    </em></p>
    
    <h1>Task Analysis</h1>

    <table style="width:100%">
      <tr>
        <th>Domain Task</th>
        <th>Analytic Level</th>
        <th>Search Task</th>
        <th>Analyze Task</th>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Examining the vendors that will be at the event, what will they be selling?</td>
        <td>Identify</td>
        <td>Explore, Locate</td>
        <td>Discover</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>What category do the vendors fall into?</td>
        <td>Identify</td>
        <td>Locate</td>
        <td>Present</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>How does the amount that the vendors want to sell wholesale vary?</td>
        <td>Summarize</td>
        <td>Browse</td>
        <td>Present</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
        <td>Where are the vendors located?</td>
        <td>Summarize</td>
        <td>Locate</td>
        <td>Present</td>
      </tr>
    </table>

    <h1>Conclusion</h1>

    <p><em>The visualization produced by this project gives an overview of the vendors that attended the Sustainable Business Network of Massachusetts’ trade show in 2019. The user is able to interact with both the map and the treemap in order to learn more about specific vendors that they may be interested in. This dataset focuses on specialty vendors, but in the future something similar could be made to include all vendors. This type of visualization would work well on SBN’s website as a way to introduce the different vendors available and entice buyers to attend the show.</em></p>
