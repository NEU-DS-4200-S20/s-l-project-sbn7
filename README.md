## How to Use
* Map of New England - This identifies where all the vendors are located in the New England area through their zip codes. The orange symbolizes all the vendors. To find out more information about vendors, select the area that you want to explore and the orange will turn to green, symbolizing that you have selected the zip code. If you look to the right, you will see that the tree map is highlighted. The parts that are highlighted symbolize what the vendors that you have selected are selling. The table on the bottom will also show more information about those vendors. There is also a legend to make it clearer. 
* Treemap: The treemap on the left shows what each of the vendors are selling. This is divided into four categories: Mushroooms, Vegetables, Herbs/Plants, and Other. If you want to learn more about a certain item that the vendors are selling, simply highlight what you would like to learn more about and that part will get highlighted on the New England Map so you could see where the item is coming from. It will also show more information about the vendor(s) on the table. 
* Table: This has all the information that was given about the vendor. We wanted to make it so that the data loads based on what the users want to get more information on so it wasnâ€™t too cluttered or overwhelming. Based on what you highlight in the New England Map or Tree Map, the data for the corresponding vendor(s) will be shown in the table.
